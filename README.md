A PHP engine for Diversity components, by [Textalk](http://www.textalk.com/).

Diversity components search engine optimized (SEO) web components,
specified by mustache templates, supporting dependencies, backend
fetching of data over JSON-RPC, supporting AngularJS templating on the
frontend (by doing collected manual bootstrapping).

This component system is constructed for use with [Textalk
Webshop](http://www.textalk.com/webshop), but is in no way limited to
that use.
